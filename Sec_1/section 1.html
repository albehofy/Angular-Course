<h1 id="introduction-to-angular">Introduction to Angular</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-angular-">What is Angular?</h2>
<p>Angular is a <strong>JavaScript framework</strong> that provides a structured way to build web applications. It consists of a <strong>collection of packages</strong>, tools, and predefined rules to follow when developing applications. Some of the key features of Angular include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection of tools and features</strong> such as CLI, debugging utilities, and IDE support.</li>
<li><strong>Component-based architecture</strong>, making it easy to maintain and scale applications.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> and TypeScript (TS).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-use-angular-">Why Use Angular?</h3>
<p>When using traditional JavaScript, we write <strong>imperative code</strong>, meaning we describe every step of execution to the browser. However, Angular follows a <strong>declarative approach</strong>, where we define the desired outcome, and Angular handles the execution process.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Use Angular:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Declarative Code:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In vanilla JavaScript, we manually specify how things should be done.</li>
<li>Angular automates many processes, reducing boilerplate code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Separation of Concerns via Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Component</strong> is the smallest unit in Angular.</li>
<li>It is a custom HTML element that contains <strong>HTML, CSS, and logic</strong>.</li>
<li>Using components, we break large applications into smaller, maintainable parts.</li>
<li>This makes it easy to <strong>share work among team members</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-of-an-angular-component">Example of an Angular Component</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-typescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { Component } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'@angular/core'</span>;

@Component({
  selector: <span class="hljs-string">'app-hello'</span>,
  template: `&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Angular!&lt;/h1&gt;`,
  styles: [`h1 { color: blue; }`]
})
<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> HelloComponent {}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="interview-questions-and-answers-">Interview Questions and Answers:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>What are the key differences between imperative and declarative programming?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imperative programming</strong> is a paradigm where the code explicitly defines how a task is performed step by step. It requires detailed instructions on every operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example in JavaScript:<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> numbers = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
<span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> doubled = [];
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; numbers.<span class="hljs-built_in">length</span>; i++) {
  doubled.<span class="hljs-built_in">push</span>(numbers[i] * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
}
console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(doubled);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Here, we manually loop through each number and push the doubled value to a new array.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Declarative programming</strong>, on the other hand, focuses on describing what should be done rather than how it should be executed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example using Angular’s template syntax:<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> *<span class="hljs-attr">ngFor</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"let num of numbers"</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{ num * 2 }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>The framework handles iteration and rendering without requiring explicit looping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imperative requires explicit steps; declarative focuses on describing outcomes.</li>
<li>Imperative is often more verbose; declarative allows for more concise and readable code.</li>
<li>In Angular, templates and bindings use a declarative approach to make the UI more intuitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How does Angular improve the maintainability of large applications?</strong></p>
<p>Angular provides several features that make it easier to maintain large applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Component-based architecture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Applications are divided into modular components.</li>
<li>Each component encapsulates its own logic, template, and styles.</li>
<li>Encourages reuse and separation of concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Modular structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code is divided into separate modules.</li>
<li>Features can be loaded lazily, improving performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TypeScript support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provides static typing, reducing runtime errors.</li>
<li>Improves IDE support with autocompletion and refactoring tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dependency Injection (DI):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Angular’s DI system helps manage services efficiently.</li>
<li>Reduces tight coupling between components and dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CLI tools for automation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generates components, services, and modules quickly.</li>
<li>Ensures a consistent project structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Suppose we have a large e-commerce app. Without Angular, we might have a single, large file managing product listings, shopping carts, and payments. In Angular, these can be split into separate modules (<code>ProductModule</code>, <code>CartModule</code>, <code>PaymentModule</code>), making development and debugging easier.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to test and debug.</li>
<li>Codebase is more readable and scalable.</li>
<li>Developers can work on different modules independently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are the advantages of using a component-based architecture?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Components can be used across different parts of the application, reducing duplication.</li>
<li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Components contain their own styles and logic, preventing unintended side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Small, independent components are easier to modify and debug.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Large applications are easier to manage when broken into smaller parts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="difference-between-vite-and-webpack-in-angular">Difference Between Vite and Webpack in Angular</h2>
<h3 id="-vite-vs-webpack-in-angular-"><strong>Vite vs. Webpack in Angular</strong></h3>
<p>Both <strong>Vite</strong> and <strong>Webpack</strong> are module bundlers used in modern web development, but they have key differences in performance and workflow:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Vite</th>
<th>Webpack</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Compilation Speed</strong></td>
<td>Uses <strong>ESBuild</strong>, making it much faster during development.</td>
<td>Uses a complex build process that can be slower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Hot Module Replacement (HMR)</strong></td>
<td>Instant updates with minimal reloading.</td>
<td>HMR exists but is slower than Vite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Configuration</strong></td>
<td>Pre-configured for best performance with minimal setup.</td>
<td>Requires extensive configuration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Build Speed</strong></td>
<td>Faster due to optimized dependency pre-bundling.</td>
<td>Slower as it processes everything at build time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Code Splitting</strong></td>
<td>Built-in automatic code splitting.</td>
<td>Code splitting needs to be manually configured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Production Optimization</strong></td>
<td>Uses ESBuild for minification, resulting in smaller bundles.</td>
<td>Uses Terser, which is slower than ESBuild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Support for Angular</strong></td>
<td>Officially supported in recent Angular versions for improved DX.</td>
<td>Traditional bundler for Angular projects.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="-which-one-to-use-"><strong>Which One to Use?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Vite if:</strong> You want <strong>faster development speed</strong>, better DX, and modern performance optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>Use Webpack if:</strong> You have a legacy Angular project that already depends on Webpack configurations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evolution-of-angular-versions-overview-">Evolution of Angular (Versions Overview)</h2>
